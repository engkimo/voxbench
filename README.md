# VoxBench

VoxBench is an early OSS implementation of the schema and registry foundation
described in `DESIGN.md`.

Phase 0 only includes:

- config and capability manifest JSON Schemas
- SQLAlchemy models and an Alembic initial migration for `plugins` and `configs`
- overlay resolution, deterministic resolved-config hashing, and static manifest validation
- example manifests/configs and acceptance tests

Phase 0 intentionally does not build or call an engine harness, PipeCat pipeline,
Gemini, Asterisk, SIP/RTP, telemetry ingest, or a web UI.

## Install for development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Resolve and validate a config

The CLI resolves optional parent overlays, validates referenced plugin manifests,
prints the resolved config, and prints the deterministic SHA-256 hash.

```bash
voxbench resolve-config \
  --config examples/configs/valid-baseline.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/engine/asterisk.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/provider/gemini.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/processor/resampler.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/processor/agc.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/processor/limiter.json \
  --manifest examples/manifests/processor/serializer.json
```

The same behavior is available as a Python API:

```python
from voxbench.registry.service import RegistryService

service = RegistryService.from_files(
    config_paths=["examples/configs/valid-baseline.json"],
    manifest_paths=[
        "examples/manifests/engine/asterisk.json",
        "examples/manifests/provider/gemini.json",
        "examples/manifests/processor/resampler.json",
        "examples/manifests/processor/agc.json",
        "examples/manifests/processor/limiter.json",
        "examples/manifests/processor/serializer.json",
    ],
)
resolved = service.resolve_config("baseline")
print(resolved.hash)
```

## Verification

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```
